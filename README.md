The AI Data Analyst project showcases how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to automate and enhance the data analysis process. The goal is to build a smart interface that can process raw datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate visual insights, and even provide interpretations â€” all with minimal human intervention. Using modern tools such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and NLP-based AI assistants, the project demonstrates how AI can assist in identifying trends, outliers, and correlations in data, making it easier for decision-makers to draw conclusions without deep technical expertise.
